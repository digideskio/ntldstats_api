Response Format
***************

Status codes are used properly. If you get a 200 response, you can expect the normal response body as documented. Otherwise the response body will contain a plain text error message.

For example, if you donâ€™t include the Authorization header, you will get a 401 UNAUTHORIZED status code.

All response have at least a **code** and a **msg** field. Calls which return additional data will return a **resData** field.

Successful call response example:

		"msg": "Command completed successfully"
	}

The returned MIME type from requests is always

All result codes base on RFC5730_ (Extensible Provisioning Protocol, EPP)

Authentication
**************

You need a valid API Token to use our API. Please sign in to the dashboard and generate a new token if you haven't done it by now.

The API needs you to provide the API Token either as HTTP Header **X-API-TOKEN** or as HTTP Basic Authenticate username on every request. It is also possible to post it as URL parameter **token** append to every endpoint.
